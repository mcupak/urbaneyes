UrbanEyes
=========
UrbanEyes is an app that allows researchers and planners of urban settings to collect data for mapping. Planners are involved in diverse areas ranging from urban ecological studies, to utilities management, to condominium development. What ties all of these jobs together is the importance of location â€“ where things are situated in urban space. This report outlines the functionality of UrbanEyes as a tool for Urban planners to collect the locations that they need, and quickly upload and use them in mapping software on desktop computers.

The project consists of an Android app (client) for collection of data based on the spacial location and web application (server) for aggregation of the collected data, administration and export of collected data to formats recognized as input by specialized mappping and urban planning software.
